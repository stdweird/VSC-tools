usage: myscoop <executable> <args>
supported options: myscoop -H (and check the SCOOP section)

This directory contains the myscoop module and some SCOOP example wrapper modules
    myscoop : mympirun SCOOP support
    __main__ : SCOOP bootstrap

    workers:
        sanity: SCOOP sanity tester (e.g. myscoop --sched=local --scoop_module=sanity 1000)
        picalc : SCOOP piCalc demo (e.g. myscoop --sched=local --scoop_module=picalc 100 100 # arg1 = nr_batches, arg2 = batch_size )
        simple_shell : run command, return (ec,output); has SCOOP_COUNTER environment variable
            arg1 is checked for [start:]stop[:step] to determine number of runs
            known issue: lots of output can cause a hang (eg dmesg won't work)
            e.g. myscoop --sched=local 100:200 echo '\$SCOOP_COUNTER'
