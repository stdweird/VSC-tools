            - total_processes : number of processes to be distributed over total_cpus
            - process_idx : process index in range of total_processes

        This algorithm will attempt to do packed placement for oversubscribed processes
        (e.g. if 2 cores are available for 4 processes, processes 0 and 1 will be pinned on core 0 and
        processes 2 and 3 on core 1).

        The algorithm will attempt to group cores for same process and not share if not needed (e.g.
        for 4 cores available and 3 process the placment will be [[0],[0],[1],[2]] rather then [[0],[0,1],[1],[2]]).
